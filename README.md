The story of this project begins with two questions -

  1. Can the topic 'food delivery app' be interpreted in a different way?
  2. Can you build an actually usable app with an admin panel and ecommerce being only one year into web development?

The answers to both those questions, is yes.

For the first question, yes, we can take this in a different context because I mean one can always make a zomato clone minus the live order tracking make the api endpoints for dishes, then for orders and finally end up with a neat little list of orders placed with quantity and total price, you know, the whole nine yards, minus the ninth yard, where you actually pay for your stuff, if you're really clever you may even add that in using an integration or making it yourself but then those apps already exist, and will need restaurant registrations to work irl.

### tl;dr - food delivery app already done, clone will not work irl

So here goes, this app is actually made so that you can basically sell it to a vendor and all they need to do is make an account on the popular payment gateway, stripe, and it's ready to go out of the box. You can basically use th admin panel to add all your dishes and actually conduct e-commerce on the app.
I have set the payment gateway up as a test environment, use the card number 4242 4242 4242 4242, any valid date MM/YY, any CVV XXX, any name, and so on, to conduct a test payment, and you will see that it actually works!

For the second question, also yes, following a few online blog posts and tutorials, and typing out all the code myself, I found I could actaully leverage enough from other devs to make the entire app. I feel like this in itself is a testament to how far we have come as a communnity of developers, where we can actually share our skills with each other to the point that a guy can literally make an e-comm app in a few days with just a year of experience.


### That said, I hope it works and I hope you enjoy using it! Cheers!

If you're still reading, I have a story for you. When I was starting out as a web developer, I came across this video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIg8jGmCvq4, which showed someone's personal e-commerce project, and I genuinely thought I'd only be able to make something like this well after graduation. It's always been a goal for me to make something like it, and that is why i've chosen this to be my core project. Following the DevSoc Roadmap, I was actually able to make something similar just one year into college. Thank you guys so much! :)
I have still had to followed documentation, tutorials and blog posts to build this app, of course, but I'm glad I don't just copy code, but actually understand what I'm typing, and am able to apply what I learn and imporve on existing code, and merge multiple existing resources into a new app.
